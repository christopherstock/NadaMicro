                    PHPUnit setup and testrunner invocation via composer.
                    Namespaces and namespace usage (multiple class file usages) in PHP.
                    Install and run PHPDocumentor via composer and bash support.

09.10.2018, day 02: Install Jenkins on Windows.
                    Create and configure a Jenkinsfile and a multibranch pipeline.
                    Webhooks and Build Triggers will never work with a localhost Jenkins.
                    Jenkins as localhost on Windows with Git Shell is just a pain in the ass!

                    Install composer on AWS.
                    Enjoy flawless Jenkins Multibranch Pipelines with GIT Sources on AWS.
                    Jenkins Webhooks are .. many different inoperative plugins?

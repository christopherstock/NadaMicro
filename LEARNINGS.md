08.10.2018, day 01: Composer Autoloading, PHP 7.2 Namespaces.
                    PHPUnit setup and testrunner invocation via composer.
                    Namespaces and namespace usage (multiple class file usages) in PHP.
                    Install and run PHPDocumentor via composer and bash support.
                    Create composer scripts ( for dev execution, PHPUnit tests and PHPDocumentor generation )
                    
09.10.2018, day 02: Install Jenkins on Windows.
                    Create and configure a Jenkinsfile and a multibranch pipeline.
                    Webhooks and Build Triggers will never work with a localhost Jenkins.
                    Jenkins as localhost on Windows with Git Shell is just a pain in the ass!

                    Install composer on AWS.
                    Enjoy flawless Jenkins Multibranch Pipelines with GIT Sources on AWS.
                    Jenkins Webhooks are .. many different inoperative plugins?
